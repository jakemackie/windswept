### 2. Doppler Authentication

> To keep our envionments safe, Windswept has 3 different configs between **Dev**, **Staging** and **Production**. Unless you're apart of the [Windswept Development Team](https://github.com/orgs/windswept-bot/people), you won't have access to these environments and will need to setup your own Doppler flow that works for you.

- Create an account on https://doppler.com/
- Create a Workspace (free for personal use)
- Configure your environment(s) to use these variables names (unless you'd like to change them):
  - ```
    DATABASE_URL
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
    DISCORD_TOKEN
    TEST_GUILD_ID
    ```
- Follow the Doppler CLI docs to install Doppler onto your machine.
- Login to your account.
  - ```
    doppler login
    ```
- Setup your Workspace by selecting from your environments.
  - > For me, this would be **Dev**.
    ```
    doppler setup
    ```

That's it! You've created a free doppler account which allows you to manage multiple secrets without an env file, sweet. ðŸ‘€

### 3. Install packages

To install the required project packages using Node, please run:

```bash
npm install
```

> You can see which packages this project utilises by viewing [package.json](https://github.com/windswept-bot/windswept/blob/deployment/staging/package.json). We aim to keep this project fairly lightweight, with 0 vulnerabilities by only using maintained, trusted packages.

### 4. Run the project!

You're ready to go. This handy script handles setting up your local Docker Database for you, just **make sure that you're running Docker first**, otherwise the Database will fail!

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see pretty terminal messages that indicate everything's working!
